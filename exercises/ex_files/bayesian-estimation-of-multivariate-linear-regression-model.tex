Consider a linear regression model with multiple regressors:
$$Y = X\beta + u$$ with $u \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I)$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Name the idea and general procedure when estimating this model with Bayesian methods.
    \item Provide an expression for the likelihood function $p(Y|\beta,\sigma^2)$.
    \item Assume that $\sigma^2$ is known and the prior distribution for $\beta$ is Gaussian with mean $\beta_0$ and covariance matrix $\Sigma_0$. Derive an expression for the posterior distribution $p(\beta|\sigma^2,Y)$.
    \item Assume that $\beta$ is known and the prior distribution for $1/\sigma^2$ is Gamma with shape parameter $s_0$ and scale $v_0$. Derive an expression for the posterior distribution $p(1/\sigma^2|\beta,Y)$.
    \item Now assume that both $\beta$ and $\sigma^2$ are unknown. Provide intuition behind and an overview of the basic steps of the Gibbs sampling algorithm.
\end{enumerate}
