Consider a general DSGE model given in the framework of SGU
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Define the dimensions of the framework.

    \item Ouline the method by Klein to get approximated policy functions with perturbation.

    \item Show for the Brockman and Mirman model that the approximated policy function computed by DYNARE and Klein's algorithm are numerically equivalent.
\end{enumerate}
